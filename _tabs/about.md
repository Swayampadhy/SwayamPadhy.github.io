## üé§ Conference Presentations

### üéôÔ∏è The Threat Triplet: RATs, Keyloggers, and Registry Keys

**Presented at HINT-24 (Springer Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems - LNNS)**

- Demonstrated how **RATs, keyloggers, and registry keys** work together to **compromise systems**.
- Explored **persistence techniques** used in **modern malware**.
- Provided **detection and mitigation strategies** to counter these threats.

## üèó Notable Projects

### üîê [CurveLock](https://github.com/Swayampadhy/CurveLock) (Jan 2025)

- Developed a ransomware prototype leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to encrypt files with high efficiency.
- Implemented advanced anti-analysis techniques such as API hammering and compile-time Import Address Table (IAT) randomization for enhanced evasion.
- Utilized process hollowing by leveraging clean ntdll.dll copies from suspended processes to bypass security hooks.
- Embedded mechanisms for escalating privileges dynamically, including token manipulation and abuse of high-privileged processes, to extend ransomware capabilities.
- Incorporated DcSync attack capabilities to dump all username-NTLM hash combinations in an Active Directory network.

### üõ† [ShadowChain](https://github.com/Swayampadhy/ShadowChain) (Dec 2024)

- ShadowChain is designed as a modular DLL injector, allowing flexibility in injecting DLLs into target processes.
- Implements DRM features to protect the payloads and their functionality, ensuring controlled distribution and execution.
- Utilizes Thread Local Storage (TLS) callbacks for anti-debugging mechanisms and makes it difficult for reverse engineers and debuggers to analyze the injector.
- ShadowChain utilizes the Windows Startup folder as a persistence mechanism by creating a copy of the injector at runtime into the startup folder which the system automatically executes whenever the user logs into Windows.
- Supports a wide range of payloads, making the tool adaptable to various use cases while maintaining a high level of security and obfuscation.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [CryoLeak](https://github.com/Swayampadhy/CryoLeak) (Nov 2023)

- CryoLeak utilizes a C#-based server-grunt C2 model for managing multiple implants remotely to control systems remotely.
- The system uses a RESTful API over HTTP for secure command issuance and result retrieval from its implants, ensuring operations are stealthy and secure.
- Supports a broad array of commands for extensive remote system management, including file operations, system queries, and advanced control functions.
- Built the Team Server using ASP.NET Core for scalability and security.

### üíª [BlueNovember](https://github.com/Swayampadhy/BlueNovember) (Aug 2023)

- BlueNovember is designed as an offensive driver with capabilities to bypass kernel-level security measures including antivirus defenses and built-in Windows protection mechanisms like Kernel Patch Protection (KPP) and callbacks.
- The driver is capable of modifying process protections and privileges, enabling actions that typically require higher permissions such as changing process tokens and disabling kernel callbacks.
- It includes techniques to evade Microsoft‚Äôs PatchGuard that protects kernel integrity, by exploiting race conditions and operational gaps in its monitoring processes.
- Developed a handler using C++ with WinAPI wrappers to execute commands and manage the driver‚Äôs operations.
