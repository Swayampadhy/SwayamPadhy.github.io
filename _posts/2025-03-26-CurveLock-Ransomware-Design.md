description: A Brief Overview of The Design Of CurveLock Ransomware
---

# [CurveLock](https://github.com/Swayampadhy/CurveLock)

A mordern ransomware designed from scratch to infect faster and encrypt target contents using Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm.

## Disclaimer 
------------

This project is a demonstration and should not be used maliciously. Developing or deploying ransomware without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this code.

## Features Of CurveLock - 
------------

1. Utilizes Api Hammering to obfuscate call stack of the ransomware to evade detection from sandbox environments
2. Creates a random compile time IAT seed to evade static detection
3. Unhooks NTDll by creating a suspended process, copying the clean Ntdll from it and replacing out NTDll in the `.text` section
4. Extracts process token and checks it's elevation and integrity and determines it it is being run as Admin or not.
5. If not being run as admin, it exploits CVE-2024-6769 to create a new process with high integrity token. Cve Link -> https://github.com/fortra/CVE-2024-6769/tree/main
6. Exploits DcSync using the DCSyncer tool (https://github.com/notsoshant/DCSyncer) to extract username and NTLM hash combinations from the domain controller and parses it.
7. Performs self deletion to avoid manual analysis after execution.
8. Embeds the Ransomware Payload into a `.PNG` file's IDAT sections and encrypts each section with it's own RC4 key.
9. Payload is extracted from the `.PNG` file at runtime and executed.
10. Also provides the decryptor for the encrypted files.

_Flowchart Of CurveLock_

## Features Of CurveLock's Payload - 
-----------------

1. ECC with Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used to generate the AES-256 keys.
2. Each file in encrypted with it's own AES-256 key and the keys are stored in the registry under - "HKCU_CURRENT_USER\CONTROL PANEL"

## Encryption Details - 

#### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Operations
ECC is used in the code to securely generate a shared secret between two parties (na and nb). This secret is then used to derive the AES key. 

The elliptic curve is defined by the equation:

#### AES-256 Encryption
The function Aes256EncryptBuffer encrypts a data buffer using AES-256 in CBC mode.

## Steps To Run
---------------------

1. Build The Solution
2. Host all the required exploits and the files given in "Attacker Server Files" in a web server.
3. Execute the CurveLock binary in the target machine.
